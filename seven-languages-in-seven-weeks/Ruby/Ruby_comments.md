# My Thoughts on Ruby!

Overall, I think I picked up a half-baked understanding of Ruby. I found with this chapter I was getting a bare-minimum understanding of the language.

That being said, I am most likely going to spend some more time learning and working with this language. 

I've always seen people who are totally crazy about Ruby, but I haven't seen any real reasons to switch to using it.

I'm still currently not crazy enough about it that I will switch over, but I am likely going to pick it up more later.
